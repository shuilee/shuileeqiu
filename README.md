Hi 👋! I’m Thu Thuy Le (Shui Lee), currently a final-year student at FPT University.
For nearly two years, I have been conducting research in federated learning for medical image analysis, focusing on privacy-preserving, robust, and scalable learning systems for real-world clinical environments.

My work lies at the intersection of machine learning and healthcare, with an emphasis on topics such as decentralized training, semi-supervised and partially-labeled learning, cross-institutional collaboration, and secure FL frameworks. I am deeply motivated by the challenge of building models that remain reliable, efficient, and generalizable across diverse medical centers while respecting strict privacy constraints.

I am always excited to discuss new ideas, exchange knowledge, or collaborate on impactful research projects.
Feel free to reach out to me anytime!
